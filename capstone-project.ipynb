    "This project aims to gather data from 3 different datasources related to US immigration and tourism data, and transform them into a star schema with tables designed to optimize queries on the data. The main goal is to provide trends and insights about the volume of trips and the time of the year.\n",

    " - Ingest 3 different datasets related to US Immigration Data, Airlines and Global Temperature\n",
    " - Explore and asses the data using this Notebook\n",
    " - Run data quality checks and exclude data that won't be used\n",
    " - Model a star schema to store the final data model \n",
    " - Create an ETL to read the raw data, transform it and load it into a trusted zone area in a datlake.\n",
    " - The analytical tables in the trusted zone will be stored as parquet files\n",
    " - Everything will be ready to be loaded into a DW, if necessary\n",
    " - Provide a few analytical queries to validate the final tables\n",
